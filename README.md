# InteractiveAlias

This project contains my work on making alias analysis interactive in LLVM.

In order to run this, the [instrumented
LLVM](https://github.com/webmiche/llvm-project/commit/14662569a19b515af5c115039c37d44b44bc7444)
needs to be available under `../llvm-project/build_interactive`. This is not fundamental, but how I have set
up my local file system, so deal with it ;)
